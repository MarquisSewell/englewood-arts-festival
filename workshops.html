         <h3>When people gather in circles magic happens. 
We listen with our hearts to one another. 
We respect one another's'experience and opinion. 
We are witnesses for one another, without judgment. 
We share our authentic expression.
We honor confidentiality.
We allow the place of “not–knowing” 
and trust to guide our inquiry.
 

Circles have proven to be an anchor for transformation in the life of a participant. Through deep compassionate listening and honest sharing of personal experiences peace is felt within and ripples out.

         <h3>Yoga is perhaps the only form of activity which massages all the internal glands and organs of the body in a thorough manner, including those such as the prostate that hardly get externally stimulated during our entire lifetime. Yoga acts in a wholesome manner on the various body parts. This stimulation and massage of the organs in turn benefits us by keeping away disease and providing a forewarning at the first possible instance of a likely onset of disease or disorder. </h3>
